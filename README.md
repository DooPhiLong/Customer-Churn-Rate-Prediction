## üíº Case study
- Based on a data set about the behaviors, characteristics, and services that customers have used of a home appliance retail store. Build machine learning algorithm models to predict customer abandonment rates.
- From there, the store can determine which customers are most likely to stay with the store long-term to be able to provide loyalty policies for them, or can determine which customers are most likely to be will leave in the near future so that we can increase communication and information sharing to retain them. The ultimate goal is to help stores save on customer service costs by using policies for each type of customer at the right time.
## üìÅ Data set
### I only have 1 data table 7043 rows and 21 features about customer behavioral information, below are 5 rows of sample data :
